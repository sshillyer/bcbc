TODO:
Figure out the syntax for adding a function to a schema. FOr example,
I want to be able to type the following:

	var execId = Executor.getIdByUsername("Bob");

See the executor-schema.js file; I think I remember that it needs to be done before calling mongoose.model,
but the syntax is foggy... maybe need a reference to 'this' ? Check mongoose docs
